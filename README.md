This project focuses on comprehensive data analysis of an e-commerce dataset using SQL and Python.
The data, initially stored in CSV files, was imported and structured in a MySQL database for efficient querying and analysis.
The project aimed to extract valuable insights, such as identifying unique customer locations, analyzing order counts, calculating total sales per product category, and determining revenue contributions from different segments.

SQL was employed to execute various queries, providing a robust understanding of the dataset's underlying patterns.
To further support strategic business decisions, data visualization techniques were applied using Python's Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries. 
These visualizations helped in presenting the findings in a clear and impactful manner, making it easier to communicate key insights to stakeholders.
The project demonstrates the integration of SQL and Python for effective data analysis and visualization in an e-commerce context.
